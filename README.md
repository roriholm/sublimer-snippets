# sublimer-snippets
A utility for managing LaTeX snippets in Sublime Text. Two annoyances:

* Sublime Text doesn't allow more than one snippet per file.

* Sublime Text requires lots of escape characters to use things like $ and \ in a snippet.

My custom snippets file avoids both of these problems, and my script blows out the custom snippet file into properly escaped XML in different files that Sublime Text can pick up directly.

Simple script with everything hardcoded for my own usage.
